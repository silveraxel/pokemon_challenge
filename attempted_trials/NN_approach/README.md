Implementation of Neural Networks classifier based for the FDS pokemon challenge.
In order to reduce overfitting and allow more generalization of the network, many tricks very implemented, such as reduced latent dimension, noise on the data, k-fold. Indeed, results are around 80%, clarifying that the correct approach is based on the features preprocessing.
