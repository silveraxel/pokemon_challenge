# # FDS Challenge: Starter Notebook
# 
# This notebook will guide you through the first steps of the competition. Our goal here is to show you how to:
# 
# 1.  Load the `train.jsonl` and `test.jsonl` files from the competition data.
# 2.  Create a very simple set of features from the data.
# 3.  Train a basic model.
# 4.  Generate a `submission.csv` file in the correct format.
# 5.  Submit your results.
# 
# Let's get started!

# ### 1. Loading and Inspecting the Data
# 
# When you create a notebook within a Kaggle competition, the competition's data is automatically attached and available in the `../input/` directory.
# 
# The dataset is in a `.jsonl` format, which means each line is a separate JSON object. This is great because we can process it one line at a time without needing to load the entire large file into memory.
# 
# Let's write a simple loop to load the training data and inspect the first battle.

# In[1]:


import json
import pandas as pd
import os

# --- Define the path to our data ---
COMPETITION_NAME = 'fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025'
DATA_PATH = os.path.join('../input', COMPETITION_NAME)

train_file_path = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'train.jsonl')
test_file_path = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'test.jsonl')
train_data = []

# Read the file line by line
print(f"Loading data from '{train_file_path}'...")
try:
    with open(train_file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            # json.loads() parses one line (one JSON object) into a Python dictionary
            train_data.append(json.loads(line))

    print(f"Successfully loaded {len(train_data)} battles.")

    # Let's inspect the first battle to see its structure
    print("\n--- Structure of the first train battle: ---")
    if train_data:
        first_battle = train_data[0]
        
        # To keep the output clean, we can create a copy and truncate the timeline
        battle_for_display = first_battle.copy()
        battle_for_display['battle_timeline'] = battle_for_display.get('battle_timeline', [])[:2] # Show first 2 turns
        
        # Use json.dumps for pretty-printing the dictionary
        print(json.dumps(battle_for_display, indent=4))
        if len(first_battle.get('battle_timeline', [])) > 3:
            print("    ...")
            print("    (battle_timeline has been truncated for display)")


except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"ERROR: Could not find the training file at '{train_file_path}'.")
    print("Please make sure you have added the competition data to this notebook.")


# ### 2. Basic Feature Engineering
# 
# A successful model will likely require creating many complex features. For this starter notebook, however, we will create a very simple feature set based **only on the initial team stats**. This will be enough to train a model and generate a submission file.
# 
# It's up to you to engineer more powerful features!

# In[2]:


from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
import numpy as np

def create_simple_features(data: list[dict]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    A very basic feature extraction function.
    It only uses the aggregated base stats of the player's team and opponent's lead.
    """
    feature_list = []
    for battle in tqdm(data, desc="Extracting features"):
        features = {}
        
        # --- Player 1 Team Features ---
        p1_team = battle.get('p1_team_details', [])
        if p1_team:
            features['p1_mean_hp'] = np.mean([p.get('base_hp', 0) for p in p1_team])
            features['p1_mean_spe'] = np.mean([p.get('base_spe', 0) for p in p1_team])
            features['p1_mean_atk'] = np.mean([p.get('base_atk', 0) for p in p1_team])
            features['p1_mean_def'] = np.mean([p.get('base_def', 0) for p in p1_team])

        # --- Player 2 Lead Features ---
        p2_lead = battle.get('p2_lead_details')
        if p2_lead:
            # Player 2's lead Pok√©mon's stats
            features['p2_lead_hp'] = p2_lead.get('base_hp', 0)
            features['p2_lead_spe'] = p2_lead.get('base_spe', 0)
            features['p2_lead_atk'] = p2_lead.get('base_atk', 0)
            features['p2_lead_def'] = p2_lead.get('base_def', 0)

        # We also need the ID and the target variable (if it exists)
        features['battle_id'] = battle.get('battle_id')
        if 'player_won' in battle:
            features['player_won'] = int(battle['player_won'])
            
        feature_list.append(features)
        
    return pd.DataFrame(feature_list).fillna(0)

# Create feature DataFrames for both training and test sets
print("Processing training data...")
train_df = create_simple_features(train_data)

print("\nProcessing test data...")
test_data = []
with open(test_file_path, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        test_data.append(json.loads(line))
test_df = create_simple_features(test_data)

print("\nTraining features preview:")
print(train_df.head())

# ### 3. Training a Baseline Model
# 
# Now that we have some features, let's train a simple `LogisticRegression` model. This will give us a starting point for our predictions.

# In[3]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Define our features (X) and target (y)
features = [col for col in train_df.columns if col not in ['battle_id', 'player_won']]
X_train = train_df[features]
y_train = train_df['player_won']

X_test = test_df[features]

# Initialize and train the model
print("Training a simple Logistic Regression model...")
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model training complete.")


# ### 4. Creating the Submission File
# 
# The competition requires a `.csv` file with two columns: `battle_id` and `player_won`. Let's use our trained model to make predictions on the test set and format them correctly.

# In[9]:


# Make predictions on the test data
print("Generating predictions on the test set...")
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Create the submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'battle_id': test_df['battle_id'],
    'player_won': test_predictions
})

# Save the DataFrame to a .csv file
submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)

print("\n'submission.csv' file created successfully!")
print(submission_df.head())


# ### 5. Submitting Your Results
# 
# Once you have generated your `submission.csv` file, there are two primary ways to submit it to the competition.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Method A: Submitting Directly from the Notebook
# 
# This is the standard method for code competitions. It ensures that your submission is linked to the code that produced it, which is crucial for reproducibility.
# 
# 1.  **Save Your Work:** Click the **"Save Version"** button in the top-right corner of the notebook editor.
# 2.  **Run the Notebook:** In the pop-up window, select **"Save & Run All (Commit)"** and then click the **"Save"** button. This will run your entire notebook from top to bottom and save the output, including your `submission.csv` file.
# 3.  **Go to the Viewer:** Once the save process is complete, navigate to the notebook viewer page. 
# 4.  **Submit to Competition:** In the viewer, find the **"Submit to Competition"** section. This is usually located in the header of the output section or in the vertical "..." menu on the right side of the page. Clicking the **Submit** button this will submit your generated `submission.csv` file.
# 
# After submitting, you will see your score in the **"Submit to Competition"** section or in the [Public Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?).
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Method B: Manual Upload
# 
# You can also generate your predictions and submission file using any environment you prefer (this notebook, Google Colab, or your local machine).
# 
# 1.  **Generate the `submission.csv` file** using your model.
# 2.  **Download the file** to your computer.
# 3.  **Navigate to the [Leaderboard Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?)** and click on the **"Submit Predictions"** button.
# 4.  **Upload Your File:** Drag and drop or select your `submission.csv` file to upload it.
# 
# This method is quick, but keep in mind that for the final evaluation, you might be required to provide the code that generated your submission.
# 
# Good luck!
